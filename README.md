### ✅ To Use This:

1. Save it as `README.md` in the root of your project.
2. Take some screenshots of your app (`Dashboard`, `Search`, `Dark Mode`) and save them in `/public/screenshots/` folder or wherever you like. Just update the image paths accordingly.

Would you like help generating mock screenshots if you haven’t taken any yet?

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
